physiognomy alone nor brain alone is worthy for the Muse, I say\\n    the Form complete is worthier far,\\nThe Female equally with the Male I sing.\\n\\nOf Life immense in passion, pulse, and power,\\nCheerful, for freest action form\\'d under the laws divine,\\nThe Modern Man I sing.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  As I Ponder\\'d in Silence\\n\\nAs I ponder\\'d in silence,\\nReturning upon my poems, considering, lingering long,\\nA Phantom arose before me with distrustful aspect,\\nTerrible in beauty, age, and power,\\nThe genius of poets of old lands,\\nAs to me directing like flame its eyes,\\nWith finger pointing to many immortal songs,\\nAnd menacing voice, What singest thou? it said,\\nKnow\\'st thou not there is hut one theme for ever-enduring bards?\\nAnd that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles,\\nThe making of perfect soldiers.\\n\\nBe it so, then I answer\\'d,\\nI too haughty Shade also sing war, and a longer and greater one than any,\\nWaged in my book with varying fortune, with flight, advance\\n    and retreat, victory deferr\\'d and wavering,\\n(Yet methinks certain, or as good as certain, at the last,) the\\n    field the world,\\nFor life and death, for the Body and for the eternal Soul,\\nLo, I too am come, chanting the chant of battles,\\nI above all promote brave soldiers.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  In Cabin\\'d Ships at Sea\\n\\nIn cabin\\'d ships at sea,\\nThe boundless blue on every side expanding,\\nWith whistling winds and music of the waves, the large imperious waves,\\nOr some lone bark buoy\\'d on the dense marine,\\nWhere joyous full of faith, spreading white sails,\\nShe cleaves the ether mid the sparkle and the foam of day, or under\\n    many a star at night,\\nBy sailors young and old haply will I, a reminiscence of the land, be read,\\nIn full rapport at last.\\n\\nHere are our thoughts, voyagers\\' thoughts,\\nHere not the land, firm land, alone appears, may then by them be said,\\nThe sky o\\'erarches here, we feel the undulating deck beneath our feet,\\nWe feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion,\\nThe tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\\n    briny world, the liquid-flowing syllables,\\nThe perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm,\\nThe boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here,\\nAnd this is ocean\\'s poem.\\n\\nThen falter not O book, fulfil your destiny,\\nYou not a reminiscence of the land alone,\\nYou too as a lone bark cleaving the ether, purpos\\'d I know not\\n    whither, yet ever full of faith,\\nConsort to every ship that sails, sail you!\\nBear forth to them folded my love, (dear mariners, for you I fold it\\n    here in every leaf;)\\nSpeed on my book! spread your white sails my little bark athwart the\\n    imperious waves,\\nChant on, sail on, bear o\\'er the boundless blue from me to every sea,\\nThis song for mariners and all their ships.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To Foreign

glass,\\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn\\'d up to the clouds,\\n    or down a lane or along the beach,\\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;\\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek\\'d bush-boy, (behind me\\n    he rides at the drape of the day,)\\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals\\' feet, or the\\n    moccasin print,\\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,\\nNigh the coffin\\'d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;\\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,\\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,\\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,\\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,\\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the\\n    diameter of eighty thousand miles,\\nSpeeding with tail\\'d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,\\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\\nI tread day and night such roads.\\n\\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\\nAnd look at quintillions ripen\\'d and look at quintillions green.\\n\\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\\n\\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\\n\\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.\\n\\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\\n    pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\\n\\nI ascend to the foretruck,\\nI take my place late at night in the crow\\'s-nest,\\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,\\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is\\n    plain in all directions,\\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my\\n    fancies toward them,\\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to\\n    be engaged,\\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still\\n    feet and caution,\\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin\\'d city,\\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities\\n    of the globe.\\n\\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\\nI turn the bridgroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,\\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\\n\\nMy voice is the wife\\'s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\\nThey fetch my man\\'s body up dripping and drown\\'d.\\n\\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\\nThe courage of present times and all times,\\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the\\n    steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of\\n    days and faithful of nights,\\nAnd chalk\\'d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will\\n    not desert you;\\nHow he follow\\'d with them and tack\\'d with them three days and\\n    would not give it up,\\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\\nHow the lank loose-gown\\'d women look\\'d when boated from the\\n    side of their prepared graves,\\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\\n    sharp-lipp\\'d unshaved men;\\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\\nI am the man, I suffer\\'d, I was there.\\n\\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\\nThe mother of old, condemn\\'d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her\\n    children gazing on,\\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\\n    blowing, cover\\'d with sweat,\\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous\\n    buckshot and the bullets,\\nAll these I feel or am.\\n\\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,\\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn\\'d with the\\n    ooze of my skin,\\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\\n\\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the\\n    wounded person,\\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\\n\\nI am the mash\\'d fireman with breast-bone broken,\\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,\\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\\nThey have clear\\'d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.\\n\\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,\\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared\\n    of their fire-caps,\\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\\n\\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.\\n\\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort\\'s bombardment,\\nI am there again.\\n\\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\\nAgain to my listening ears the cannon responsive.\\n\\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim\\'d shots,\\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,\\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,\\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\\n\\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves\\n    with his hand,\\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me--mind--the entrenchments.\\n\\n     34\\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\\n\\'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve\\n    young men.\\n\\nRetreating they had form\\'d in a hollow square with their baggage for\\n    breastworks,\\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their\\n    number, was the price they took in advance,\\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv\\'d writing and\\n    seal, gave up their arms and march\\'d back prisoners of war.\\n\\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\\n\\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and\\n    massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\\nThe work commenced about five o\\'clock and was over by eight.\\n\\nNone obey\\'d the command to kneel,\\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,\\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead\\n    lay together,\\nThe maim\\'d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,\\nSome half-kill\\'d attempted to crawl away,\\nThese were despatch\\'d with bayonets or batter\\'d with the blunts of muskets,\\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz\\'d his assassin till two more\\n    came to release him,\\nThe three were all torn and cover\\'d with the boy\\'s blood.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock began the burning of the bodies;\\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\\n\\n     35\\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother\\'s father the sailor told it to me.\\n\\nOur foe was no sulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer,\\n    and never was, and never will be;\\nAlong the lower\\'d eve he came horribly raking us.\\n\\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch\\'d,\\nMy captain lash\\'d fast with his own hands.\\n\\nWe had receiv\\'d some eighteen pound shots under the water,\\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire,\\n    killing all around and blowing up overhead.\\n\\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\\nTen o\\'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain,\\n    and five feet of water reported,\\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold\\n    to give them a chance for themselves.\\n\\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\\n\\nOur frigate takes fire,\\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\\n\\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part\\n    of the fighting.\\n\\nOnly three guns are in use,\\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy\\'s main-mast,\\nTwo well serv\\'d with grape and canister silence his musketry and\\n    clear his decks.\\n\\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\\n    the main-top,\\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\\n\\nNot a moment\\'s cease,\\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.\\n\\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.\\n\\nSerene stands the little captain,\\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\\n\\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.\\n\\n     36\\nStretch\\'d and still lies the midnight,\\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the\\n    one we have conquer\\'d,\\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a\\n    countenance white as a sheet,\\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv\\'d in the cabin,\\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully\\n    curl\\'d whiskers,\\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,\\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh\\n    upon the masts and spars,\\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,\\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,\\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by\\n    the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\\nThe hiss of the surgeon\\'s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long,\\n    dull, tapering groan,\\nThese so, these irretrievable.\\n\\n     37\\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\\nIn at the conquer\\'d doors they crowd! I am possess\\'d!\\nEmbody all presences outlaw\\'d or suffering,\\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain.\\n\\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,\\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr\\'d at night.\\n\\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff\\'d to jail but I am handcuff\\'d to him\\n    and walk by his side,\\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat\\n    on my twitching lips.)\\n\\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried\\n    and sentenced.\\n\\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,\\nMy face is ash-color\\'d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.\\n\\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,\\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\\n\\n     38\\nEnough! enough! enough!\\nSomehow I have been stunn\\'d. Stand back!\\nGive me a little time beyond my cuff\\'d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,\\nI discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.\\n\\nThat I could forget the mockers and insults!\\nThat I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\\n    bludgeons and hammers!\\nThat I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and\\n    bloody crowning.\\n\\nI remember now,\\nI resume the overstaid fraction,\\nThe grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,\\nCorpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\\n\\nI troop forth replenish\\'d with supreme power, one of an average\\n    unending procession,\\nInland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\\nOur swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\\nThe blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.\\n\\nEleves, I salute you! come forward!\\nContinue your annotations, continue your questionings.\\n\\n     39\\nThe friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\\nIs he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\\n\\nIs he some Southwesterner rais\\'d out-doors? is he Kanadian?\\nIs he from the Mississippi country?

  his hips and wrists,\\nIt is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist\\n    and knees, dress does not hide him,\\nThe strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and

live-oak growing,\\nAll alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,\\nWithout any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green,\\nAnd its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,\\nBut I wonder\\'d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there\\n    without its friend near, for I knew I could not,\\nAnd I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it and\\n    twined around it a little moss,\\nAnd brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,\\nIt is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,\\n(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)\\nYet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;\\nFor all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana\\n    solitary in a wide in a wide flat space,\\nUttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,\\nI know very well I could not.\\n\\n\\n\\n}  To a Stranger\\n\\nPassing stranger! you do not know

   1\\nAfoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,\\nHealthy, free, the world before me,\\nThe long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.\\n\\nHenceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,\\nHenceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,\\nDone with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,\\nStrong and content I travel the open road.\\n\\nThe earth, that is sufficient,\\nI do not want the constellations any nearer,\\nI know they are very well where they are,\\nI know they suffice for those who belong to them.\\n\\n(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,\\nI carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,\\nI swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,\\nI am fill\\'d with them, and I will fill them in return.)\\n\\n     2\\nYou road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all\\n    that is here,\\nI believe that much unseen is also here.\\n\\nHere the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,\\nThe black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas\\'d, the\\n    illiterate person, are not denied;\\nThe birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar\\'s tramp, the\\n    drunkard\\'s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,\\nThe escaped youth, the rich person\\'s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,\\nThe early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the\\n    town, the return back from the town,\\nThey pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can be interdicted,\\nNone but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.\\n\\n     3\\nYou air that serves me with breath to speak!\\nYou objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!\\nYou light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!\\nYou paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!\\nI believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me.\\n\\nYou flagg\\'d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!\\nYou ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined\\n    side! you distant ships!\\nYou rows of houses! you window-pierc\\'d facades! you roofs!\\nYou porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!\\nYou windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!\\nYou doors and ascending steps! you arches!\\nYou gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!\\nFrom all that has touch\\'d you I believe you have imparted to\\n    yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,\\nFrom the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces,\\n    and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.\\n\\n     4\\nThe earth expanding right hand and left hand,\\nThe picture alive, every part in its best

back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,\\nYou express me better than I can express myself,\\nYou shall be more to me than my poem.\\n\\nI think heroic deeds were all conceiv\\'d in the open

whoever I see must be happy.\\n\\n     5\\nFrom this hour I ordain myself loos\\'d of limits and imaginary lines,\\nGoing where I list, my own master total and absolute,\\nListening to others, considering well what they say,\\nPausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,\\nGently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that\\n    would hold me.\\n\\nI inhale great draughts of space,\\nThe east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.\\n\\nI am larger, better than I thought,\\nI did not know I held so much goodness.\\n\\nAll seems beautiful to

go,\\nI will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,\\nWhoever denies me it shall not trouble me,\\nWhoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.\\n\\n     6\\nNow if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,\\nNow if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear\\'d it would not\\n    astonish me.\\n\\nNow I see the secret of the making of the best persons,\\nIt is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.\\n\\nHere a great personal deed has room,\\n(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,\\nIts effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all\\n    authority and all argument against it.)\\n\\nHere is the test of wisdom,\\nWisdom is not finally tested in schools,\\nWisdom cannot be pass\\'d from one having it to another not having it,\\nWisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,\\nApplies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,\\nIs the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the\\n    excellence of things;\\nSomething there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes\\n    it out of the soul.\\n\\nNow I re-examine philosophies and religions,\\nThey may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the\\n    spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.\\n\\nHere is realization,\\nHere is a man tallied--he realizes here what he has in him,\\nThe past, the future, majesty, love--if they are vacant of you, you\\n    are vacant of them.\\n\\nOnly the kernel of every object nourishes;\\nWhere is he who tears off the husks for you and me?\\nWhere is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?\\n\\nHere is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion\\'d, it is apropos;\\nDo you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?\\nDo you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?\\n\\n     7\\nHere is the efflux of the soul,\\nThe efflux of the soul comes from within through embower\\'d gates,\\n    ever provoking questions,\\nThese yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?\\nWhy are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight\\n    expands my blood?\\nWhy when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?\\nWhy are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious\\n    thoughts descend upon me?\\n(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always\\n    drop fruit as I pass;)\\nWhat is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?\\nWhat with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?\\nWhat with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by\\n    and pause?\\nWhat gives me to be free to a woman\\'s and man\\'s good-will? what\\n    gives them to be free to mine?\\n\\n     8\\nThe efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,\\nI think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,\\nNow it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.\\n\\nHere rises the fluid and attaching character,\\nThe fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of\\n    man and woman,\\n(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day\\n    out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet\\n    continually out of itself.)\\n\\nToward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the\\n    love of young and old,\\nFrom it falls distill\\'d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,\\nToward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.\\n\\n     9\\nAllons! whoever you are come travel with me!\\nTraveling with me you find what never tires.\\n\\nThe earth never tires,\\nThe earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at first, Nature is rude\\n    and incomprehensible at first,\\nBe not discouraged, keep on, there are divine things well envelop\\'d,\\nI swear to you there are divine things more beautiful than words can tell.\\n\\nAllons! we must not stop here,\\nHowever sweet these laid-up stores, however convenient this dwelling\\n    we cannot remain here,\\nHowever shelter\\'d this port and however calm these waters we must\\n    not anchor

yet take warning!\\nHe traveling with me needs the best blood, thews, endurance,\\nNone may come to the trial till he or she bring courage and health,\\nCome not here if you have already spent the best of yourself,\\nOnly those may come who come in sweet and determin\\'d bodies,\\nNo diseas\\'d person, no rum-drinker or venereal taint is permitted here.\\n\\n(I and mine do not convince by

   weird-singer, or something else.\\n\\nAll this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,\\nThe words of true poems do not merely please,\\nThe true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;\\nThe greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers\\n    and fathers,\\nThe words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.\\n\\nDivine

poems give you more than poems,\\nThey give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war,\\n    peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and every thing else,\\nThey balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,\\nThey do not seek beauty, they are sought,\\nForever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing,\\n    fain, love-sick.\\n\\nThey prepare for death, yet are they not the finish, but rather the outset,\\nThey bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,\\nWhom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to\\n

indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe as air,\\nA chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,\\nA murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,\\nVoice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.\\n\\nFarewell my brethren,\\nFarewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,\\nMy time has ended, my term has come.\\n\\nAlong the northern coast,\\nJust back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,\\nIn the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,\\nWith the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,\\nWith crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms,\\nRiven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood\\n    forest dense,\\nI heard the might tree its death-chant chanting.\\n\\nThe choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,\\nThe quick-ear\\'d teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not,\\nAs the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to\\n    join the refrain,\\nBut in my soul I plainly heard.\\n\\nMurmuring out of its myriad leaves,\\nDown from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,\\nOut of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,\\nThat chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only but\\n    the future.\\n\\nYou untold life of me,\\nAnd all you venerable and innocent joys,\\nPerennial hardy life of me with joys \\'mid rain and many a summer sun,\\nAnd the white snows and night and the wild winds;\\nO the great patient rugged joys, my soul\\'s strong joys unreck\\'d by man,\\n(For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, identity,\\nAnd all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)\\nJoys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,\\nOur time, our term has come.\\n\\nNor yield we mournfully majestic brothers,\\nWe who have grandly fill\\'d our time,\\nWith Nature\\'s calm content, with tacit huge delight,\\nWe welcome what we wrought for through the past,\\nAnd leave the field for them.\\n\\nFor them predicted long,\\nFor a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time,\\nFor them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings.\\'\\nIn them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks, Shasta, Nevadas,\\nThese huge precipitous cliffs, this amplitude, these valleys, far Yosemite,\\nTo be in them absorb\\'d, assimilated.\\n\\nThen to a loftier strain,\\nStill prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,\\nAs if the heirs, the deities of the West,\\nJoining with master-tongue bore part.\\n\\nNot wan from Asia\\'s fetiches,\\nNor red from Europe\\'s old dynastic slaughter-house,\\n(Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and\\n    scaffolds everywhere,\\nBut come from

the muffled shriek, the groan,\\nSuch words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices ecstatic,\\n    ancient and rustling,\\nThe century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,\\nAll their

around us means,\\nOn the plain below recruits are drilling and exercising,\\nThere is the camp, one regiment departs to-morrow,\\nDo you hear the officers giving their orders?\\nDo you hear the clank of the muskets?\\nWhy what comes over you now old man?\\nWhy do you tremble and clutch my hand so convulsively?\\nThe troops are but drilling, they are yet surrounded with smiles,\\nAround them at hand the well-drest friends and the women,\\nWhile splendid and warm the afternoon sun shines down,\\nGreen the midsummer verdure and fresh blows the dallying breeze,\\nO\\'er proud and peaceful cities and arm of the sea between.\\n\\nBut drill and parade are over, they march back to quarters,\\nOnly hear that approval of hands! hear what a clapping!\\n\\nAs wending the crowds now part and disperse--but we old man,\\nNot for nothing have I brought you hither--we must remain,\\nYou to speak in your turn, and I to listen and tell.\\n\\n     [The Centenarian]\\nWhen I clutch\\'d your hand

raged,\\nAs eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv\\'d with applause of friends,\\nBut a battle which I took part in myself--aye, long ago as it is, I\\n    took part in it,\\nWalking then this hilltop, this same ground.\\n\\nAye, this is the ground,\\nMy blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,\\nThe years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,\\nRude forts appear again, the old hoop\\'d guns are mounted,\\nI see the lines of rais\\'d earth stretching from river to bay,\\nI mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;\\nHere we lay encamp\\'d, it was this time in summer also.\\n\\nAs I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,\\nIt was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,\\nBy his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up\\n    his unsheath\\'d sword,\\nIt glitter\\'d in the sun in full sight of the army.\\n\\nTwas a bold act then--the English war-ships had just arrived,\\nWe could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,\\nAnd the transports swarming with soldiers.\\n\\nA few days more and they landed, and then the battle.\\n\\nTwenty thousand were brought against us,\\nA veteran force furnish\\'d with good artillery.\\n\\nI tell not now the whole of the battle,\\nBut one brigade early in the forenoon order\\'d forward to engage the\\n    red-coats,\\nOf that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march\\'d,\\nAnd how long and well it stood confronting death.\\n\\nWho do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?\\nIt was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,\\nRais\\'d in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally\\n    to the General.\\n\\nJauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus\\' waters,\\nTill of a sudden unlook\\'d for by defiles through the woods, gain\\'d at night,\\nThe British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing\\n    their guns,\\nThat brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy\\'s mercy.\\n\\nThe General watch\\'d them from this hill,\\nThey made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,\\nThen drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,\\nBut O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!\\n\\nIt sickens me yet, that slaughter!\\nI saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.\\nI saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.\\n\\nMeanwhile the British manoeuvr\\'d to draw us out for a pitch\\'d battle,\\nBut we dared not trust the chances of a pitch\\'d battle.\\n\\nWe fought the fight in detachments,\\nSallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was\\n    against us,\\nOur foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push\\'d us back\\n    to the works on this hill,\\nTill we turn\\'d menacing here, and then he left us.\\n\\nThat was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand\\n    strong,\\nFew return\\'d, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.\\n\\nThat and here my General\\'s first battle,\\nNo women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude\\n    with applause,\\nNobody clapp\\'d hands here then.\\n\\nBut in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,\\nWearied that night we lay foil\\'d and sullen,\\nWhile scornfully laugh\\'d many an arrogant lord off against us encamp\\'d,\\nQuite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over\\n    their victory.\\n\\nSo dull and damp and another day,\\nBut the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,\\nSilent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my\\n    General retreated.\\n\\nI saw him at the river-side,\\nDown by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;\\nMy General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass\\'d over,\\nAnd then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for\\n    the last time.\\n\\nEvery one else seem\\'d fill\\'d with gloom,\\nMany no doubt thought of capitulation.\\n\\nBut when my General pass\\'d me,\\nAs he stood in his boat and look\\'d toward the coming sun,\\nI saw something different from capitulation.\\n\\n     [Terminus]\\nEnough, the Centenarian\\'s story ends,\\nThe two, the past and present, have interchanged,\\nI myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now speaking.\\n\\nAnd is this the ground Washington trod?\\nAnd these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he cross\\'d,\\nAs resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?\\n\\nI must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,\\nI must preserve that look as it beam\\'d on you rivers of Brooklyn.\\n\\nSee--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,\\nIt is the 27th of August and the British have landed,\\nThe battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke\\n    Washington\\'s face,\\nThe brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march\\'d forth to intercept\\n    the enemy,\\nThey are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,\\nRank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,\\nBaptized that day in many a young man\\'s bloody wounds.\\nIn death, defeat, and sisters\\', mothers\\' tears.\\n\\nAh, hills and slopes of Brooklyn!

bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)\\nI stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster\\'s face is white as a lily,)\\nThen before I depart I sweep my eyes o\\'er the scene fain to absorb it

doctor\\'s shouted orders or calls,\\nThe glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of\\n    the torches,\\nThese I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,\\nThen hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;\\nBut first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,\\nThen the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the

of children and women,\\nThe many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail\\'d,\\nAnd the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy\\n    with labor,\\nAnd the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with\\n    its meals and minutia of daily usages,\\nAnd the streets how their throbbings throbb\\'d, and the cities pent--\\n    lo, then and

hands of\\n    companions,\\nI fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,\\nDown to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,\\nTo the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.\\n\\nAnd the singer so shy to the rest receiv\\'d me,\\nThe gray-brown bird I know receiv\\'d us comrades three,\\nAnd he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.\\n\\nFrom deep secluded recesses,\\nFrom the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,\\nCame the carol of the bird.\\n\\nAnd the charm of the carol rapt me,\\nAs I held as if by their hands my comrades in the night,\\nAnd the voice of my spirit tallied the song of the bird.\\n\\nCome lovely and soothing death,\\nUndulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,\\nIn the day, in the night, to all, to each,\\nSooner or later delicate death.\\n\\nPrais\\'d be the fathomless universe,\\nFor life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,\\nAnd for love, sweet love--but praise! praise! praise!\\nFor the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.\\n\\nDark mother always gliding near with soft feet,\\nHave none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?\\nThen I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,\\nI bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.\\n\\nApproach strong deliveress,\\nWhen it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,\\nLost in the loving floating ocean of thee,\\nLaved in the flood of thy bliss O death.\\n\\nFrom me to thee glad serenades,\\nDances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and feastings for thee,\\nAnd the sights of the open landscape and the high-spread shy are fitting,\\nAnd life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.\\n\\nThe night in silence under many a star,\\nThe ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,\\nAnd the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil\\'d death,\\nAnd the body gratefully nestling close to thee.\\n\\nOver the tree-tops I float thee a song,\\nOver the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the\\n    prairies wide,\\nOver the dense-pack\\'d cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,\\nI float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death.\\n\\n     15\\nTo the tally of my soul,\\nLoud and strong kept up the gray-brown bird,\\nWith pure deliberate notes spreading filling the night.\\n\\nLoud in the pines and cedars dim,\\nClear in the freshness moist and the swamp-perfume,\\nAnd I with my comrades there in the night.\\n\\nWhile my sight that was bound in my eyes unclosed,\\nAs to long panoramas of visions.\\n\\nAnd I saw askant the armies,\\nI saw as in noiseless dreams hundreds of battle-flags,\\nBorne through the smoke of the battles and pierc\\'d with missiles I saw them,\\nAnd carried hither and yon through the smoke, and torn and bloody,\\nAnd at last but a few shreds left on the staffs, (and all in silence,)\\nAnd the staffs all splinter\\'d and broken.\\n\\nI saw battle-corpses, myriads of them,\\nAnd the white skeletons of young men, I saw them,\\nI saw the debris and debris of all the slain soldiers of the war,\\nBut I saw they were not as was thought,\\nThey themselves were fully at rest, they suffer\\'d not,\\nThe living remain\\'d and suffer\\'d, the mother suffer\\'d,\\nAnd the wife and the child and the musing comrade suffer\\'d,\\nAnd the armies that remain\\'d suffer\\'d.\\n\\n     16\\nPassing the visions, passing the night,\\nPassing, unloosing the hold of my comrades\\' hands,\\nPassing the song of the hermit bird and the tallying song of my soul,\\nVictorious song, death\\'s outlet song, yet varying ever-altering song,\\nAs low and wailing, yet clear the notes, rising and falling,\\n    flooding the night,\\nSadly sinking and fainting, as warning and warning, and yet again\\n    bursting with joy,\\nCovering the earth and filling the spread of the heaven,\\nAs that powerful psalm in the night I heard from recesses,\\nPassing, I leave thee lilac with heart-shaped leaves,\\nI leave thee there in the door-yard, blooming, returning with spring.\\n\\nI cease from my song for thee,\\nFrom my gaze on thee in the west, fronting the west, communing with thee,\\nO comrade lustrous with silver face in the night.\\n\\nYet each to keep and all, retrievements out of the night,\\nThe song, the wondrous chant of the gray-brown bird,\\nAnd the tallying chant, the echo arous\\'d in my soul,\\nWith the lustrous and drooping star with the countenance full of woe,\\nWith the holders holding my hand nearing the call of the bird,\\nComrades mine and I in the midst, and their memory ever to keep, for\\n    the dead I loved so well,\\nFor the sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands--and this

immortality.\\n\\nThe soul is of itself,\\nAll verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,\\nAll that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,\\nNot a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day,\\n    month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,\\nBut the same affects him or her onward afterward through the\\n    indirect lifetime.\\n\\nThe indirect is just as much as the direct,\\nThe spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the\\n    body, if not more.\\n\\nNot one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of\\n    the onanist,\\nPutridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,\\n    betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,\\nBut has results beyond death as really as before death.\\n\\nCharity and personal force are the only investments worth any thing.\\n\\nNo specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that\\n    is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,\\nIn the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope\\n    of it forever.\\n\\nWho has been wise receives interest,\\nSavage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat,\\n    young, old, it is the same,\\nThe interest will come round--all will come round.\\n\\nSingly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect,\\n    all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,\\nAll the brave actions of war and peace,\\nAll help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful,\\n    young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn\\'d persons,\\nAll self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw\\n    others fill the seats of the boats,\\nAll offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a\\n    friend\\'s sake, or opinion\\'s sake,\\nAll pains of enthusiasts scoff\\'d at by their neighbors,\\nAll the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,\\nAll honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,\\nAll the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,\\nAll the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name,\\n    date, location,\\nAll that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,\\nAll suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his\\n    mouth, or the shaping of

 consummation, and that from some other,\\nWithout the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the\\n    beginning than any.\\n\\nWhatever satisfies souls is true;\\nPrudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,\\nItself only finally satisfies the soul,\\nThe soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson\\n    but its own.\\n\\nNow I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time,\\n    space, reality,\\nThat answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.\\n\\nWhat is prudence is indivisible,\\nDeclines to separate one part of life from every part,\\nDivides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,\\nMatches every thought or act by its correlative,\\nKnows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,\\nKnows that the young man who composedly peril\\'d his life and lost it\\n    has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,\\nThat he who never peril\\'d his life, but retains it to old age in\\n    riches and ease, has probably achiev\\'d nothing for himself worth\\n    mentioning,\\nKnows that only that person has really learn\\'d who has learn\\'d to\\n    prefer results,\\nWho favors body and soul the same,\\nWho perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,\\nWho in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor\\n    avoids

hold any faith in results,\\n(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious\\n    and inevitable, and they again leading to other results.)\\n\\nHow the great cities appear--how

unform\\'d, and is for a while between things ended\\n    and things begun,\\nHow America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of\\n    freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and\\n    of all that is begun,\\nAnd how the States are complete in themselves--and how all triumphs\\n    and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,\\nAnd how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be\\n    convuls\\'d, and serve other parturitions and transitions,\\nAnd how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses too,\\n    serve--and how every fact, and war itself, with all its horrors,\\n    serves,\\nAnd how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death.\\n\\n     2\\nOf seeds dropping into the ground, of births,\\nOf
